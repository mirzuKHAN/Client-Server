to compile the file you just need to open it in an IDE (PyCharm preferably)
and run it
if you want to test it with the server file on the same machine,
you may just create a project with server.py on it and add the source file to it
(type localhost when queried about ip address when testing on one machine)

to note: post_file method may not work on every machine,
you may want to edit the save paths a little. If it still does not work,
try again, it must save the files to the given path.
